Registration Form Web Project

This project is a professional-style registration form that allows users to fill in their details, save them locally using localStorage, and manage the submitted data with Edit and Delete functionality. It includes animations, background effects, and extra usability features like password strength indicators and file name previews.

✅ How it Works

Fill in the form fields and submit.

Form data is validated and stored in localStorage.

Table auto-refreshes and displays new data.

Use Edit to update a row.

Use Delete to remove it from the list.

⚠️ Note: All data is stored locally in your browser only. Refreshing the page keeps the data saved, but clearing browser data will remove it.

📌 Requirements

Any modern web browser

No internet required (after loading SweetAlert CDN)
